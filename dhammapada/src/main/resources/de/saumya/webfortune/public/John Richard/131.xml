  He who does violence to the peaceful and harmless soon encounters one of
  ten things - He may experience cruel pain, disaster, physical injury,
  severe illness, or insanity, or else trouble with the authorities, grave
  accusation, bereavement, or loss of property, or else destruction of his
  house by fire, and on the death of his body the fool goes to hell. 137,
