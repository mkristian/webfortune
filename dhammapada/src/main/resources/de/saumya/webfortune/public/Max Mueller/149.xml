  Looking for the maker of this tabernacle, I shall have to
  run through a course of many births, so long as I do not find (him);
  and painful is birth again and again.  But now, maker of the
  tabernacle, thou hast been seen; thou shalt not make up this
  tabernacle again.  All thy rafters are broken, thy ridge-pole is
  sundered; the mind, approaching the Eternal (visankhara, nirvana), has
  attained to the extinction of all desires. 153, 154
