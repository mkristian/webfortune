  When a man venerates those worthy of veneration, be they Buddhas or
  their disciples, who have transcended all obstacles and passed beyond
  sorrow and tears - venerating such as these, whose passions are
  extinguished and for whom there is no further source for fear, no one
  can calculate how great his merit is. 195, 196
