  He who pays homage to those who deserve homage, whether the
  awakened (Buddha) or their disciples, those who have overcome the host
  (of evils), and crossed the flood of sorrow, he who pays homage to
  such as have found deliverance and know no fear, his merit can never
  be measured by anybody. 195, 196
