  It is not just by means of morality and religious observances, not by
  great learning nor by attainments in meditation, nor by living alone,
  nor by thinking,"I am enjoying a spiritual happiness which ordinary
  people do not know" that a bhikkhu achieves peace if he has not achieved
  the elimination of inflowing thoughts. 271, 272
