  I have passed in ignorance through a cycle of many rebirths, seeking the
  builder of the house. Continuous rebirth is a painful thing. But now,
  housebuilder, I have found you out. You will not build me a house again.
  All your rafters are broken, your ridge-pole shattered. My mind is free
  from active thought, and has made an end of craving. 153, 154
