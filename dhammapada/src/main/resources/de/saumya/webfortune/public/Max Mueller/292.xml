  It is hard to leave the world (to become a friar), it is hard to
  enjoy the world; hard is the monastery, painful are the houses;
  painful it is to dwell with equals (to share everything in common) and
  the itinerant mendicant is beset with pain.  Therefore let no man be
  an itinerant mendicant and he will not be beset with pain. 302
