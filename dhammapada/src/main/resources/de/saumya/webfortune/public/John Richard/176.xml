  There is no satisfying the senses, not even with a shower of money. "The
  senses are of slight pleasure and really suffering." When a wise man has
  realised this, he takes no pleasure, as a disciple of the Buddhas, even
  in the pleasures of heaven. Instead he takes pleasure in the elimination
  of craving. 186, 187
