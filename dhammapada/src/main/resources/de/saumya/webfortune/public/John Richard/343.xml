  Therefore in this religion, this is what comes first for a wise bhikkhu
  - guarding of the senses, contentment, and discipline in accordance with
  the rules of the Order. He should cultivate friends of good character,
  of pure behaviour and resolute. He should be friendly in his manner, and
  well-behaved. As a result he will experience great joy, and put an end
  to suffering. 375, 376
