  People give according to their faith, or as they feel well disposed. If
  one is put out for that reason with other people's food and drink, then
  one will not achieve stillness of mind in meditation, day or night. But
  he who has destroyed that sort of reaction, has rooted it out and done
  away with it - he will achieve stillness of mind in meditation, day and
  night. 249, 250
