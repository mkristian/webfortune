  Driven by fear, men take to many a refuge, in mountains, forests, parks,
  sacred groves and shrines, but these are not a secure kind of refuge. By
  taking to this sort of refuge one is not released from suffering. He who
  has gone to Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha for refuge, though, and who with
  true wisdom understands the Four Noble Truths of Suffering, the Origin
  of Suffering, the End of Suffering and the Noble Eightfold Path, leading
  to the Elimination of Suffering, this is a secure refuge, this is the
  ultimate refuge; by taking to this refuge one is indeed released from
  all suffering. 188, 189, 190, 191, 192
