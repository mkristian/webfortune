  The wise say that it is not an iron, wooden or fibre fetter which is a
  strong one, but the besotted hankering after trinkets, children and
  wives, that, say the wise, is the strong fetter. It drags one down, and
  loose as it feels, it is hard to break. Breaking this fetter, people
  renounce the world, free from longing and abandoning sensuality. 345,
