  It is hard to take up a life of renunciation, and difficult to find
  satisfaction in it, but it is also difficult to live in bad households,
  and painful to live with people unlike oneself, when one is forever
  tangled in suffering and restless. Therefore don't always be restless,
  and don't let yourself be tangled in suffering. 302
