  A wise man should leave the dark state (of ordinary life), and
  follow the bright state (of the Bhikshu).  After going from his home
  to a homeless state, he should in his retirement look for enjoyment
  where there seemed to be no enjoyment.  Leaving all pleasures behind,
  and calling nothing his own, the wise man should purge himself from
  all the troubles of the mind. 87, 88
