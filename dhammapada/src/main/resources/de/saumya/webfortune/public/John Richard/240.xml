  A shaven head does not make one a man of religion, if one is irreligious
  and untruthful. How could a man full of desires and greed be a man of
  religion? But when a man has put aside all evil deeds, both great and
  small, by that putting away of evil deeds he is indeed called a man of
  religion. 264, 265
