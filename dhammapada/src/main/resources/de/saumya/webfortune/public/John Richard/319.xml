  When a man is stimulated by his own thoughts, full of desire and
  dwelling on what is attractive, his craving increases even more. He is
  making the fetter even stronger. But he who takes pleasure in stilling
  his thoughts, practising the contemplation of what is repulsive, and
  remaining recollected, now he will make an end of craving, he will snap
  the bonds of Mara. His aim is accomplished, he is without fear, rid of
  craving and without stain. He has removed the arrows of changing
  existence. This is his last body. 349, 350, 351
