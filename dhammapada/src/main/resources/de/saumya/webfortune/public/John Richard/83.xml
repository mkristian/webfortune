  A wise man, abandoning the principle of darkness, should cultivate what
  is pure. Leaving home for the homeless life, let him seek his joy in the
  solitude which people find so hard to enjoy, and, abandoning sensual
  pleasures, let him cleanse himself of inner defilements, looking on
  nothing as his own. 87, 88
