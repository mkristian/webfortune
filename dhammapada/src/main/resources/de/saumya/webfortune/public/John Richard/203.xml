  When a man who has been away a long time at last comes home safely from
  far away, his family, friends and acquaintances rejoice to see him back.
  In the same way, when a man who has done good goes from this world to
  the next, his good deeds receive him like relations welcoming a loved
  one back again. 219, 220
