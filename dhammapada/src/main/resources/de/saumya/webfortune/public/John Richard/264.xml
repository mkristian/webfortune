  What IS their affair is put aside. What is NOT their affair gets done.
  The inflow of thoughts in such brazen and careless people just goes on
  increasing. They whose recollection of the body is always well
  established, however, have nothing to do with what is not their affair,
  always persevering in what IS their affair. The inflow of thoughts in
  such recollected and aware people simply dies away. 292, 293
